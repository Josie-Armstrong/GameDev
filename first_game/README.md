## Game Tutorial
[Link to the game tutorial I followed] (https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html)

On Godot Docs, tutorial called "Your First 2D Game"

## Assets Used
- Art, fonts, and sound provided by tutorial linked above
- Heart icon by Dwi ridwanto from the noun project
- Color palette generated by [Coolors] (https://coolors.co/)

## Timeline
- Tutorial: ~5 hrs, including setup, coding, and some debugging
- Adding hearts (modification #1): 1.5 hrs
- Adding high score: 30-45 min
- Adding background colors: 30-45 min

## *Note*
*My commits are a little messy this time around, because I forgot to commit the hearts change until I was already working on the high score update. And I did my README (this document) after finishing the project rather than during. Hopefully that is okay!**
